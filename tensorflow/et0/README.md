# Implementation of 2D Ordinary Kriging algorithm and calculate Reference Evapotranspiration(ET0) on IPU using TensorFlow
## Overview
1.This project is based on [PyKrige](https://github.com/GeoStat-Framework/PyKrige), we have implemented the `example/00_ordinary.py` example by using TensorFlow on IPU. You can achieve almost the same result.  
2.ET0 is a common method for calculating meteorological elements, the calculation process of various ET0 is roughly the same, and kriging algorithm used is one of the more famous interpolation algorithms.  
3.We do interpolation analysis of weather elements such as temperature, humidity, pressure and wind speed, and use Penman equation to calculate the ET0, which can get the law of water transpiration in the area. It's of great value for the research of meteorological data mining, evaluation of numerical weather forecasting, and climate change, etc.  
4.The input form of ET0 is discrete points, the form of each point is [longitude, latitude, pressure/wind speed/temperature], and there are more than 2000 such points involved in the calculation every day.  
5.There are many models involved in kriging algorithm, we use linear semivariogram function.  
6.Our project is based on the open source kriging algorithm in `1` and the code provided by Agilor.  
## Environment
This has been tested with the following dependencies:
- Poplar SDK version 2.2
- Ubuntu 18.04
## Data
This example does not contain sample data due to its proprietary nature, but it can be reproduced using conventional Geospatial data. In order to run the example in this code, please download our dummy data [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Apa1VesWk84UgUszNcXuYRbphV4a?e=3QFTQB) and place it in the `dummy_data` folder.  
The `dummy_data` folder will contains three subfolders named `dummy_raw_data`, `dummy_recource`, and `dummy_latitude` if unzipped. The 4 txt files in `dummy_raw_data` contain the latitude,longitude and weather elements (pressure, wind speed, humidity, temperature) information of each point. The tif file in `dummy_recource` contain the elevation information of a certain area. The tif file in `dummy_latitude` contain the latitude information of a certain area.
## Quick start guide
Prepare the environment  
**1) Download the Poplar SDK**  

Install the Poplar SDK following the instructions in the [Getting Started guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-pod-getting-started/en/latest/installation.html) for your IPU system. Make sure to source the enable.sh scripts for poplar.  

**2) Python**

Create a virtualenv and install the required packages:
```
bash
virtualenv venv -p python3.6
source venv/bin/activate
pip install <path to the tensorflow-1 wheel file from the Poplar SDK>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**3) Data decompression, compile and run example script**

The program run.sh contains the steps to compile the matrix solver library and run the IPU implementation of the kriging algorithm, data decompression is also included. This example uses 1 dayâ€™s dummy data and repeated 14 times to simulate 14 days of ET0 calculations. This will run the process with 4 IPU, which will take 10 minutes to complete.
